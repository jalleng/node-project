## Setup Project
### Linting
+ use the class `.eslintrc` and `.eslintignore` files
+ put the files in your project and don't gitignore  
+ The class lint file rules include Single quotes, 2 spaces for tabs  
+ good practice to copy `.eslintrc` and `.eslintignore`  into ~/ - this allows eslint to find them if they're not in the project

#### Testing Lint  
```npm install -g eslint```  
To test in your root as TA's will:  ```eslint *```  
* Sublime  
  sublime-linter, csslint, eslint

* Atom:  
  linter, linter-eslint (packages)

### What about variables not used?

  for example in gulpfile

  ```javascript
  const watch = require('gulp-watch');
  gulp.watch('./**/*.js', ['lint', 'test']);```

  we never actually make a call with watch so we could just require

```javascript
  require('gulp-watch');```  

### Setup .gitignore
[See gitignore.io to help setup](https://www.google.com)  
Enter Node, OSX, Vim(if you use it) to git all hidden files from apps you use
Rule of thumb: ignore generated or data files as well as env variables

How to remove node-modules if accidentally commit:    
`echo 'node_modules' >> .gitignore`  
`$ git rm -r --cached node_modules`  
`$ git commit -am 'ignore node_modules'`

### Setup Assignment:
Create a folder under ~/cf/401 (for example)

Fork assignment and clone in above directory

`npm init`  
`npm install <...> --save-dev`

Package.json should contain the following to all running code and test from npm.

`"scripts": {"start": "node server.js",`  
`"test": "./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha"},`

### Directory structure:
**root:**   
server.js OR index.js OR app.js  
gulpfile.js  
.eslintrc  
.eslintignore  
.gitignore  
package.json (fill it out but it will come from npm init, set version to 0.1.0, set license to MIT)  
**folders:**  
/db  (this should be gitignored)  
/lib  
/model  
/route  
/test

#### Recommend save exact so that changes to modules you used won't bite you  
 `npm install --save --save-dev --save-exact mocha`    `npm install --save --save-exact morgan`  

#### Naming  
Lowercase filename and upper camel var names; for exmaple   
`const MyModule = require('my-module');`
